# Determining the presence and absence of nucleotide sequences.

This file is associated with the correspondingly named script. 
Both this and the annotated code were created to be submitted as coursework for a module on the author's PhD programme. 

The aim was to write a piece of code using the teaching kindly provided by staff at Bristol University to address a biological function.

To address this, the author wrote code which allows the user to be able to determine the absence or presence of a gene sequence wihin a larger genome sequence.
Given the student's  background in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and bacterial lung pathogens, four common Cystic Fibrosis lung pathogens and the AMR gene, ampR are used to show the functionality of the code. 

This code was written out of the academic interest of writing one's own code using the material provided through the teaching course. 
It is not meant to be used for other's research.
